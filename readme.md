# architect-example-indieweb

A work in progress implementation of the IndieWeb family of protocols in Architect.

## Setup

Each instance of this app requires the following environment variables: 

- `DOMAIN`
- `NAME`
- `EMAIL`

> Set env vars with the Architect CLI command `arc env --add --env MYENVVAR myvalue`

And then finally replace `public/profile.jpg` with your own avatar photo.
